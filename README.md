# Better Plain Text

This module cames into existence as a result of my own frustrations in figuring out how set up a multi-line Plain text field which respects line breaks upon display. The prototypical use case is a street address, where no "rich text" formatting is needed, no wysiwyg editor is needed, but line breaks are an integral part of the format to be displayed.

Also see this discussion: https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/5515 for further insight on the issue.

## Usage

After enabling this module, you will see three formatting options when "Plain text" processing is selected:

You will also find these options for overriding the display for any given display, as well as for Views:
