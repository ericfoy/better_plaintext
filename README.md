# Better Plain Text

This module cames into existence as a result of my own frustrations in figuring out how set up a multi-line Plain text field which respects line breaks upon display. The prototypical use case is a street address, where no "rich text" formatting is needed, no wysiwyg editor is needed, but line breaks are an integral part of the format to be displayed.
